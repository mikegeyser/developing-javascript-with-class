<h1>Developing Javascript with Class</h1>

<p>A talk on ECMAScript 6 and Google's Traceur compiler.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/mikegeyser">@mikegeyser</a> for <a href="http://www.jsinsa.com/jsinsa/2014/index.htm">JSinSA 2014</a>.</p>

<p>Stop pretending that the Javascript we're writing is object-oriented - because it's not. Stop hacking around prototypal inheritance and embrace "Harmony" - ECMAScript 6. This talk will take a detailed look at writing Javascript with the first class Object-Oriented support coming in the near future, and illustrate the use of Google's Traceur compiler to degrade gracefully into currently executable Javascript.</p>

<p><a href="http://mikegeyser.github.io/developing-javascript-with-class/#/title">Take a look at the slides</a>, and follow through the steps in the commit log to see a demo of a simple class structure converted from current javascript to ECMAScript 6 in the browser using the traceur compiler.</p>
